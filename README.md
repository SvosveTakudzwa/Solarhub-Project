## Introduction

So just like all stories, the making of this story also has a great and amusing beginning. One day when I was taking a walk in town, I happened to come by this retail shop called Solar Hub. Curious to see what services they offered, I got inside and, to my surprise, the first thing I came across was their promotional template (link in description). Before I was even asked how they could help me, I went straight to the Help Desk assistant and asked her if I could take a photo of their template. She didn't think twice or ask why I needed it, she just said, "There's no problem, go on," as if she was talking to some random kid. Without hesitation, I quickly pulled out my newly bought Huawei P20 Lite from my tattered jeans' pocket and took a photo. In a matter of minutes, I was already by the door on my way out.

## Development Process

Forgive my manners, but in my mind, I couldn't stop thinking about how I would win this battle that I had accepted. "Where would I even start?" I kept asking myself. I got home in a matter of minutes, pulled out my HP 15-bs031wm from my laptop bag, and quickly hit the power button. As I waited anxiously for it to switch on and just the few minutes it took to load to an optimum state and finish running the Startup applications, I felt as if it took years and ages. Good for me, Sublime Text, my favorite text editor, was already pinned to my taskbar, so there was no need to browse for it. Well, coders know how it all goes from here with the fingers hitting hard the keys and the spacebar button. For straight 11 hours, my eyes were wide open as I battled to produce this beautiful (for a beginner) desktop output. My next mission now is to produce the desktop version now that I'm done with the desktop version of it.
