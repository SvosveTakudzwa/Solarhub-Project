So just like all stories, the making of this story also 
has a great and amusing beginning. One day when i was 
taking a walk in town, i happened to come by this 
retail shop called Solar Hub. Curious to see what 
services they offered, i got inside and to my surprise,
the first thing i came across was their promotional
template (link in description). Before i was even 
asked how they could help me, i went straight 
to the Help Desk assistant and asked her if i
could take a photo of their template. She didn't 
think twice or ask why i needed it, she just 
said "There's no problem, go on" as if she was 
talking to some random kid. Without hesitation, 
i quickly pulled out my newly bought Huawei p20 
lite from my tattered jeans' pocket and took a photo. 
In a matter of minutes, i was already by the door
on my way out. Forgive my manners, but in my mind,
i couldn't stop thinking about how i would
win this battle that i had accepted. "Where would i even
start" i kept asking myself. I got home in a matter of minutes
pulled out m HP 15-bs031wm from my laptop bag and quickly hit 
the On button. As i waited anxiously for it to switch on
and just the few mintes it took to load to an optimum
state and finish running the StartUp applications, i felt as if 
it took years and ages. Good for me, Sublime text, my favourite
text editor was already pinned to my taskbar so there was no need to 
browse for it. Well, coders know hoe it all goes from here with the finger
hitting hard the keys and the spacebar button. For straight 11 hours 
my eyes were wide open as i battled to produce this beautiful
(for a beginner) desktop output. My next mission now is to produce 
the desktop version now that i'm done with the desktop version of it.
